  summary: Refuse quote shifts response
  description: >
    Endpoint for a supplier to refuse a quote shift response.


    Side effects:

    * Collect all quote shift responses for incoming rfq.
      * When responses with status ACCEPTED = 0:
        * if responses with status CONFIRMED = 0: set incoming rfq to REFUSED.
        * else: set status to CONFIRMED.
    * Linked quote shifts are removed from rfq shift accepted lists.

    * Set linked quote shifts to REFUSED.
