  summary: Confirm quote shifts response
  description: >
    Endpoint for a supplier to confirm a quote shift response.


    Side effects:

    * Incoming rfq set to CONFIRMED iff ACCEPTED linked quote shift responses = 0.

    * Linked quote shifts in rfq shift accepted list moved to confirmed list.

    * (When an rfq shift duplicity = confirmed quote shifts, set other
    quote shifts to REJECTED.)

    * Set linked quote shifts to CONFIRMED.
